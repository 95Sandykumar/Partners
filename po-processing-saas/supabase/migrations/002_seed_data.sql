-- Seed data for the PO Processing System
-- This creates a demo organization with vendors, templates, products, and mappings

-- Note: This seed data is for development/demo purposes.
-- In production, organizations are created through the signup flow.

-- The seed data will be inserted via the app's API after signup,
-- or you can run this manually for a specific org:

-- Example usage after creating an org:
-- Replace 'YOUR_ORG_ID' and 'YOUR_VENDOR_UUID' with actual IDs

-- Vendor templates are stored as the JSON files from the templates/ folder
-- Products from the seed_data.md
-- Mappings from the seed_data.md

-- This file serves as documentation for the seed data structure.
-- Actual seeding should be done through the API or a seed script.

-- Sample Products (to be inserted with correct org_id):
-- TRIG-600V, Trigger 600 Volt, Triggers, CM Industries, 42.64
-- GUN-300A-15, Gun 300A 15FT TWECO DP, Guns, CM Industries, 155.70
-- HEAD-INS-046, Head Insulator 046-36-001, Insulators, CM Industries, 3.28
-- TRIG-ASSY-B5662, Trigger Assembly B5662, Triggers, CM Industries, 17.15
